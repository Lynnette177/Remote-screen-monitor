# Remote-Screen-Monitor

Description: This is a project about remote desktop monitoring using the client-server (C/S) model. The server side can monitor multiple client desktops, while the client side sends desktop screenshots to the server at fixed intervals. This can be used in scenarios such as monitoring students during computer lab sessions.
